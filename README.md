Functionality:
The stopwatch should display time in the format HH:MM:SS:MS.
It should have three buttons: "Start", "Stop", and "Reset".
The time should pause when the user clicks "Stop" and resume when they click "Start" again.
Clicking "Reset" should reset the time to 00:00:00.
Implement the buttons to disable and enable correctly based on user interaction (e.g., disable "Start" when the stopwatch is running).
Design:
The app should be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes.
Use a visually appealing design with appropriate color contrasts and legible fonts.
Include subtle hover effects on buttons to enhance the user experience.
Tech Stack:
HTML for the structure.
CSS for styling and responsiveness.
JavaScript for functionality (starting, stopping, and resetting the stopwatch).
